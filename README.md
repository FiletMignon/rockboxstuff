Some custom rockbox things i'm working on!

oscilloscopexy.rock is an x-y oscilloscope plugin, currently built only for iPod Video (5G) and Rockbox 3.14. Source soon! Drag and drop it next to oscilloscope.rock in your plugins folder.
Horizontal waveform mode has been replaced with x-y mode, where L is x and R is y. Tested working with Jerobeam Fenderson's Oscilloscope Music wav files. Usually looks best in PIXEL drawing mode.
