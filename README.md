Some custom rockbox things i'm working on!

oscilloscopexy.rock is an x-y oscilloscope plugin for iPod Video (5G) and Rockbox 3.14. Drag and drop it next to oscilloscope.rock in your plugins folder.
Horizontal waveform mode has been replaced with x-y mode, where L is x and R is y. Tested working with Jerobeam Fenderson's Oscilloscope Music wav files. Usually looks best in PIXEL drawing mode.
